That peace with listening or participating and just that small intimacy of debriefing a friend's wedding and enjoying each other's company and feeling still. <span>(00:57)</span> And that's in contrast to—well, it's not necessarily contrast—but the other thing I think about is like the texts I exchange with that group of people because they live all across the country and just how I can have those really intimate moments and peaceful, quiet, domestic moments with them, but also share the dumbest stuff over text and the big things too. I didn't want that to be the thing I shared, but I think I am reminded that that's the thing that I get a strong sense of belonging from because I'm reminded every day of those folks who make me feel the most like myself. <span>(01:30)</span> And it's dumb things like memes. But it's also big things like having someone text about recently what it was like to stop breastfeeding her child for the first time since she was born and weaning off and sharing that moment in the text and then the next day you get the best and worst memes of the internet. So I feel like my sense of belonging—I don't know why I feel it—but there are certain things that remind me of it and they can be really surface level like group chats or like just the comfort of, the deep comfort of being able to share space with someone.",

Because for me, there's sort of a cycle when we pay attention. I can't help feeling like, <em>Oh, my goodness, I'm the most lucky person in the world</em> because when you to pay attention and realize you're surrounded by all these amazing beings—all bearing gifts—to me, attention leads to \"gift thinking,\" to thinking about the world as not something that we own or possess or deserve or work for, but as a gift. That <em>gift understanding.</em> That's what leads us to gratitude and then leads us to reciprocity, which leads us to deeply felt and deeply lived kinning. That cycle of attention, gift, gratitude, kinning. <span>(00:54)</span>When you’re kinning in reciprocity, what are you doing? You’re paying more attention, which cycles you right back. So it’s this beautiful, powerful motive force of gift, gratitude, and reciprocity, driven by attention.<span>(01:08)</span>One of the practices of attending that I think helps us feel a sense of belonging in the natural world is the same process that makes us feel like we belong in social situations. I have a four-year-old grandson who just began pre-K and he says, “Well, I don’t know anybody there.” So we chatted about the importance of learning the names of the kids that you’re sitting around the table with. And once you learn names, you say, \"You matter to me; we’re going to be in relationship.\" I need to know how to speak of you, how to address you.<span>(01:42)</span>I think that is the same practice of kinning that we can bring into the world. To deepen our own kinning is to learn names. I mean, it’s not just that I’m a botanist, and think we’re all going to go off and learn all those plant names, which is just a delight. You don’t have to have official names for plants and insects and rivers. What it takes is attention to get to know them well enough that you could call them by whatever name you come up with, but you know them well enough to call them by name. So just like my little sweet grandson learned to say, “Oh, what’s going to make me feel like I belong is learning names.” That’s a powerful gateway to kinship between us and our more-than-human kin as well.",

Firstly, just that we all share a common humanity and we all experience the hardness of life and the beauty and the curiosity of it all. So even just by the mere experience of us all being humans, we're connected to each other. This poem also kind of gives you the permission to just be who you are, like, be your nature, follow your desires and what's in your heart . . . <span>(01:22)</span> It's a funny day for me—a dear friend's husband—I just got word that he tried to take his life. They ended up finding him, and he's in the hospital right now. And I don't have the full context yet, but I think he's clearly having a lot of mental trouble. And I think that he made some pretty big mistakes hurting people, and from what I can gather, he probably wasn't able to cope with those choices. In the immediacy of receiving the news, and then right now, reflecting on your question—I don't know—I think there's also just this level of mercy that exists in the world that no matter what, you just want—I just want to hug him and hold him and love him no matter what he's done. <span>(02:11)</span>You know, I know there's radical mercy that exists. In my context, it's like from God, but also we all have access to that and to be that for other people. And things like this poem bring that to mind in a way, where everyone can be connected in hard times of despair. I just want to love him and I want him to know he's loved and he's beautiful and irreplaceable and he belongs. And I know I'm connected to him now even though I'm not with him and I know can send him my love.",

And yeah, I think in that moment, I just felt really connected to my family and to her. And I can't even explain why, but it brought me so much happiness and a really strong sense of connection to something bigger than myself.

For short, it didn't work out in the end, but I'm insanely grateful for that experience.

    "transcript": "<span>(00:00)</span>I thought about this for a while yesterday, and then this wonderful thing happened that made me really feel connected. And so I'll tell you what that thing was. I dropped a friend of mine off at the train station, and she and her little girl boarded a train to Connecticut. They noticed that there was a man—silverhaired gentleman—who was smiling at them the entire time that they were waiting on the platform. And though this might be disgruntling to some, my friend Val, she's got a lot of angels protecting her, so she doesn't worry about those kinds of things. And so they boarded the train, and Valerie and her little girl took their compartment. And the gentleman who had been smiling at them very grandfatheredly passed them and said hello and smiled at them with these gorgeous eyes and kept on going a few compartments ahead and settled on a seat on the opposite side of them. And a few minutes into the train ride, he came to them and said, \"I noticed you're a member of RIBS, Rhode Island Black Storytellers.\" And Valerie, of course, said, \"Yes, I am.\" And he said, \"Do you know a gentleman by the name of Rochelle Coleman?\" And she looked at the way he was smiling, and she said, \"As a matter of fact, he just dropped me off.\"  <span>(00:00)</span> And he began to tell her a story about a time that took place many years ago. We were both walking on Hope Street, and he was coming towards me, and I noticed that he was carrying this thing in his arm almost like a loaf of bread. And as we got closer and closer, I noticed that this was no loaf of bread. This was a baby. And the baby's head was in the palm of his hand. And the rest of the baby's body was straddling his forearm, almost like a waiter doing plate service, not carrying the plates on a tray, but just lined up on his arm, ready to deliver to a table. And the closer and closer these two got to me, the more I was just laughing, because this little baby was just enjoying this ride and giggling on this man's forearm, who had bright, smiling eyes and a shock of red hair. <span>(00:00)</span>Now, there was a car that was coming up behind him on Hope Street, and the car must have been as interested as I was in this scenario. And the windows rolled down, and these three boys—three young black boys—were watching this man carry this baby. And just as they passed him, three of the boys leaned out of the window and yelled, \"Man, you don't have caring no baby.\" And he looked at me, and I looked at him. It was a little shocking, and I just started laughing because this was a funny little moment. And the man looked at me and he said, \"I've carried all seven of my children in this way on these crisp fall evenings and to a tee, each one of them have enjoyed this.\" <em>But how do you argue with a man who's carried seven children that way? How do you argue with a man who's raised seven children? And how could you even question what they loved?</em> <span>(00:00)</span> Well, I would say about five years later, I went into the John F. Kennedy School, not far from where we had talked that day, and he was the PTA president. We exchanged this memory of him carrying this baby like a loaf of bread or like a waiter doing arm service. And he showed me the little girl that was that little child that he'd been carrying. She had to be in about third or fourth grade at the time. And I've always remembered that. We've met several times since then, and we've always changed this memory. And today on the train, talking to Val, he told her about this moment and the boys who had passed saying he didn't know what he was doing. Val thought that that was the funniest thing. And of course, she took a picture of him on the train and texted it to me. That man with the smiling eyes and shock of red hair, whose hair was now gray white, but he still had those same smiling eyes. <span>(00:00)</span> And as soon as I saw his picture, even though his hair had changed, I knew exactly who he was. And I certainly remembered instantly that story of passing each other on Hope Street and the young boys telling him that he didn't know how to carry a baby. And instantly I started laughing. In the caption of his picture, he said that that that little girl now had her own little girl. And it instantly made me understand my connection with Providence, with this community and the people that are in it.",

And in that moment when you can only think about breathing and moving your legs and not more than that, but you're fighting, as well, with a little voice asking you to quit and stop the suffering.

    "transcript": "<span>(00:00)</span>Basically, I got pregnant when I was, like, 23. So I was really young, and it wasn't like a planned pregnancy or anything like that. And it was really hard for me to accept the pregnancy throughout the whole thing. I literally just stayed home and, like, hid from people. I barely even told anyone I was pregnant. And then the day before my daughter was born, my dad passed, so that was really hard and after my daughter was born. I entered into this weird—not depression—I don't know what it was. I was just like, <em>I don't want to do anything.</em> But I had to because I had a child. I had to wake up early in the morning. I had to stay awake during the night to feed her. <span>(00:38)</span>So throughout the years, I noticed I kind of lost myself in a way. Generally, I've always been, like, a very playful person. My inner child was gone. I didn't want to play. I didn't want to have fun. Fun was gone for me. So until a year ago, because she's now one, I remember I hated having to play all the time. I didn't enjoy it. <span>(01:01)</span>So more or less a month ago, I was coming back home with my daughter, and it was raining, and she starts jumping in the puddles and wetting all her feet, her pants. All wet. And my initial reaction was like, <em>Oh, no, no, we have to go. We have to go. Let's not get wet.</em> But then I stayed there for a second, and I watched her, and I was like, <em>Oh, my God. I remember how fun this was when I was a kid.</em> And then I was like, <em>Wait, actually, no, we don't have to go. We can stay.</em> And I started jumping in the puddles with her, and she was laughing so much. And that's a time that makes me think of what it means to be connected. And I felt like my inner child was finally coming out again. Because I realized, <em>Oh, I didn't lose my inner child. Like, it's still there. I'm still me.</em> I just needed time. And now it's just so much better.",

A couple years ago my parents moved from California to Utah. I felt nostalgic when my parents sent photos of the California house packed up. Upon visiting their new home in Utah, I walked into the living room. The light was pouring in through big windows, and I immediately felt at home.

And there's all these different rhythms, crazy rhythms that are out there. Strange rhythms. <span>(00:23)</span> It can be electronic, it can be drums, whatever. So it's always been music. I mean, I love all of the arts, obviously, but fucking—I couldn't live without fucking music. You connect that with everything growing up, with friends, you know, identity about punk rock, different scenes and bebop—like throughout history, people have found their kind of tribe. <span>(00:43)</span> Grateful Dead is a great example. Me and my brother—that hit us. <br>I remember it really crystal clear. We're very young. I'm probably 21 with our good buddy and my brother. And we drive up and see the great Phil Lesch who was a bass player for the Greatful Dead. We're all too young, so we never saw Jerry. Jerry died. So we went up to this festival—and it's just seeing Phil playing all these tunes that we grew up to—\"Fantastic on Broken Chain\"—and just being there with my brother and our buddies and hanging out and camping and sleeping in a van and me buying beer. There was other stuff, obviously. It was a glorious weekend. Hanging out with older Heads I used to work with at one of my first college jobs who actually toured with the Dead, who was a Deadhead. Meeting him in the lot. <span>(01:29)</span> Like my uncle followed the Dead, my dad saw him in Missoula. The important thing to remember is there's concert. They had people—thank God, fucking God—people taped almost every show, predominantly. There's a lot of recorded stuff out there. So I couldn't listen to shows where my uncle was 15 and my dad was like 20, at some of their first shows because it's on tape. That's the preservation of art, which no one really thought of. They were like the first band to really—or the followers did it—and they tolerated it, kind of. And then there was a taper section. So you have all these shows—I can listen to shows that friends have been to, that older cats have been to. That's all preserved. And that's archival history right there.",

And over the summer, I was fortunate enough to go back and spend some real time connecting with my roots and also connecting with a home that I've had a lot of problems identifying with because that's the constant going back and forth from Spain to the United States. And there was one moment this summer where I was in Caamaño, which is where my mother grew up. It's a very small farm village and we go around every Sunday to this fluente, which is a kind of like a fountain, but it comes out of the mountains and we bring reusable bottles of water and we get the water from this fuente. <span</span>It was my father, my mother and I. And next to the fuente is this church where my mother's brother is buried. So it's tradition that we go get water, we give our grievances to her brother. And this time we're walking around the church, just looking around. It's been a while since we've all been there and we saw that there were some stairs to go on top of the church. So my father and I were, like, walking up the church. We're, like, now on top of the church where the bell is chiming and my mother is, like, so scared. My mom is, like, so scared because she hates heights and she's, like, yelling at us to come down. So we go down, but I take a little bit of time. <span></span>And as they were collecting the water for the fountain, I remember standing in front of the church for a couple of minutes and just closing my eyes and hearing the cows and the chickens and hearing the water run and hearing the cars pass by and feeling so at peace and so at home again. It was a moment that I was really able to connect back to my identity and also feel a lot of grief the last two years that I wasn't able to go back. And I think back to that moment a lot when I'm having hardships here in the States or I'm missing home.</br>",

And I was staying in the East Village and there's a church called Grace church—I think it's like almost 175 years old now, but I wanted to find a small church because I was by myself and I'd never done it before. But I thought, well, I'll just try and be in this company of strangers. And I walked in and sat down and I was really scared because I'd never done it before, let alone go to church. <span>(00:39)</span> But there was this really nice woman next to me. She helped me find where to start singing because I think she probably knew I'd never done it before anyway. So I'm singing, you know, all these different songs. And I remember the time we were just all in unison singing \"A Silent Night.\"<span>(01:05)</span> And I feel like I'm going to cry right now because it was so beautiful, with the candles lit and all the people together singing. It was just probably the one of the most beautiful experiences I've ever had. And I was by myself. But I did feel connected to all these people and to the story and to this really nice woman who sat next to me. And she had, too, the most beautiful voice. I could just melt. I just remember stopping because I couldn't get through the song, because I started crying. <span>(01:53)</span> But  to this day, it's like just one of the most incredible experiences I've ever had. And I really felt connected to just everything, to humanity and to the beauty of people and connected with myself and how something so simple can be so transcending. And I hadn't felt that kind of beauty before. You know, in the company of strangers, the sense of belonging was definitely part of that whole entire think.",

I think I was 16—me and my best friend cut class and she had some acid and we took it and we just went in the woods all day. And it was the best, best day ever.<br><em>At that time I was very far from the happiest I’d ever been, though not the closest to the lowest either. I hadn’t intended to do anything that day. I convinced the nurse to give me a sick day—a get-out-of-class/barn-chores-free-day—because I wasn’t “feeling well.” And then I went on this trip (my first) very spontaneously. And I’m so glad and so thankful that things lined up the way they did that day because it permanently and fundamentally changed me. I was happier after. Obviously I was prettttty happy during as well. Most notable to me was the new—or, more accurately, previously experienced but then foreign—sensation of belonging, of being included because I </em>was<em> included—because people wanted me to be and because </em>I<em> wanted to be. I've never really felt disconnected from nature, though it should be noted that nature was a big element of the whole experience for me.</em>",
